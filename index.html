			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Welcome to my portfolio page! I am a passionate developer and mathematician with experience in PDEs and 
				numerical methods, I am currently in my final year of an MMath at the University of Liverpool. I am looking
				to either get into a PhD or a job in the field of numerical methods or software development. I have experience in
				Python and MATLAB. I also have some experience in web development gained through a couple of online courses.
			</p>
			<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy doing sports especially running and squash.</p>
			<p>The goal of this page is to showcase some of my projects and hopefully get you excited about them too!</p>
			<p>Feel free to check out my projects below or get in touch!</p>

				<h3>Vibrations of an N-gon Mass-Spring System (and Further Geometry)</h3>
				<p>This is the project I completed in my third year, where I looked at the time-harmonic vibrations of various
					mass-spring systems. This resulted in some quite beautful animations of the vibrations of the systems. I also
					extended the simple N-gon geometry moving into more complex ones such as that with concentic circles. A MATLAB
					app was also developed to allow users to experiment with their own geometries in this framework, and an object 
					oriented approach was leveraged, allowing the easy creation and removing of additional masses. The project was 
					very well received by my supervisor and I was awarded the top mark in the year for it. It was also entered into
					The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) National Best Maths Project competition 2025, where it was 
					awarded first place, resulting in a Mathematics Today article being written about it. The project can be found on my
					GitHub page.

				<h3>A Spectral Problem Applied to a Chiral Multi-Structure</h3>
				<p>This is the project I am currently working on, where we are utilising gyroscopes to model the Coriolis effect experienced
					due to the rotation on Earth. This is a very interesting project as it could have some interesting geophysical applications, 
					and due to the symmetries of the system, we can formulate it fully analytically, rather than relying on complex meshing. 
					We are currently in the process of writing up the results and hope to submit it to a journal in the near future. The project
					is written in MATLAB. Some nice 3D models accompanying this project can be found <a href="threedmodels.html">here</a>.
